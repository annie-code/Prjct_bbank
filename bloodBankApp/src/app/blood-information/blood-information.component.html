        <p> There are no substitutes for blood, platelets or plasmaâ€”they cannot be manufactured. Patients in need of blood or blood products must rely on donations from people like you. Those who are hesitant about donating blood for the first time often find that the donation process is easy and that saving lives is deeply gratifying.</p>
          <p>One donation can save multiple lives. Here are the facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Just 1 donation can save up to 3 lives. </li>
          <li> The average red blood cell transfusion is 3 pints (or 3 whole-blood donations).
          </li>
          <li> Type O-negative whole blood can be transfused to people with any blood type, but this type of blood is rare, and supplies of it are low.</li>
          <li>Type AB plasma can be transfused to patients with all other blood types, but it's also in short supply. </li>

          <p>Everyone who is eligible can donate blood, but depending on your blood type, you're only able to receive certain types of blood, plasma or platelets.</p>
           <p>There are eight different blood types, and they're not always compatible with each other. Interestingly, people who have O-negative blood are considered universal donors for the entire population.</p>
